# Building_a_Highly_Available_Scalable_Web_Application

This project provides a complete estimation and deployment outline for a scalable application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It includes architecture diagrams, cost analysis, and automation scripts for provisioning resources.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Design a scalable architecture on AWS.
- Estimate infrastructure costs.
- Demonstrate setup using automated scripts.
- Showcase architecture and output using diagrams and screenshots.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2**: For scalable compute instances
- **S3 (implied)**: For storing static assets or backups
- **Bash Scripting**: Automating provisioning tasks
- **Cloud Architecture**: Designed with scalability and fault-tolerance in mind

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Review the Estimate**: Open `MyEstimate.pdf` to understand resource and cost planning.
2. **Understand the Tasks**: Refer to `Task.md` for project objectives and deliverables.
3. **View Architecture**: Go to the `Images/` folder to see architecture diagrams.
4. **Deploy with Script**:
   - Use the `UserdataScript-phase-2.sh` on an EC2 instance to automatically configure services.
   - Make sure your EC2 instance has proper IAM permissions and a security group set up.
